              <p>After working in social justice and education policy for fifteen years I am pivoting to web development. I hope someday to combine the two.</p> 
              <p>I was previously a teacher-educator, trainer and facilitator specializing in developing and delivering anti-bias teacher trainings and resources. I have extensive experience in adult education and public speaking. Most recently I led the professional development program at Teaching Tolerance at the Southern Poverty Law Center. In that capacity I designed instructional materials for online delivery, managed the content in our Learning Management System, and oversaw the design and development of both the departmental and programmatic websites. These projects spurred my interest in web development and encouraged me to enroll in a full-stack web development program. My prior work with the Anti-Defamation League and the City of Los Angeles Human Relations Commission also focused on programmatic interventions to reduce prejudice, enhance intergroup relations, and promote educational and housing equity. I received my undergraduate degree in political science from the University of California, Berkeley and my Master of Public Policy from UCLA. I hope in the future to use my expertise in adult learning, group facilitation and my commitment to social justice to create engaging and enlightening web applications. I am interested in finding part-time employment locally or full-time employment anywhere with a mission-driven company that values creativity, respects independence and rewards excellence.</p>
